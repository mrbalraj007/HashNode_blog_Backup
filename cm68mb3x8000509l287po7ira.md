This document explains how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps, Terraform, and Azure Container Web App to deploy a Python-based web application. The deployment is automated and can be started with just one click.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this project, here are some skills and tools you should be familiar with:

Need to create a PAT Access Token-

* \[x\] [Clone repository for terraform code](https://github.com/mrbalraj007/Azure_DevOps_Projects/tree/main/Azure_DevOps_All_Projects/10_Real-Time-DevOps-Project_CI-CD_Terraform_ACR_Storage_WebApp)  
    **Note**: Replace resource names and variables as per your requirement in terraform code
    
    * Update `terraform.tfvars`
        
* \[x\] [App Repo](https://github.com/mrbalraj007/python-app-docker.git)
    
* \[x\] **Azure Account**: Youâ€™ll need an Azure account to create resources like virtual Machine, AKS cluster, and manage pipelines.
    
* \[x\] **Terraform Knowledge**: Familiarity with Terraform to provision, manage, and clean up infrastructure.
    
* \[x\] **GitHub**: Experience with GitHub for version control and managing repositories.
    
* \[x\] **Command-Line Tools**: Basic comfort with using the command line for managing infrastructure and services.
    
* \[x\] **Basic CI/CD Knowledge**: Some understanding of Continuous Integration and Deployment is recommended.
    
* \[x\] **Linux VM**: Docker must be installed on a Linux virtual machine to run containers.
    

## Key Points

1. **Architecture Overview**:
    
    * The architecture includes components such as Azure Repos, Azure Storage Account, Build Pipeline, and Release Pipeline.
        
    * Terraform is used for infrastructure as code, and the state file is stored securely in Azure Storage Account.
        
2. **Build Pipeline**:
    
    * The build pipeline includes tasks to build and push a Docker image to Azure Container Registry.
        
    * Terraform configuration files are published as pipeline artifacts for use in the release pipeline.
        
3. **Release Pipeline**:
    
    * The release pipeline is linked to the artifacts published by the build pipeline.
        
    * It includes stages for deploying resources to Dev and QA environments using Terraform.
        
    * Auto-scaling and alert configurations are set up for the web app.
        
4. **Terraform Configuration**:
    
    * Separate files for providers, variables, and main configuration.
        
    * Variables are stored securely and referenced in the configuration files.
        
    * The configuration includes creating an Azure App Service Plan, Web App, Auto Scale settings, and Alerts.
        
5. **Service Connections**:
    
    * Azure DevOps service connections are created for authentication with Azure and Docker Registry.
        

## Setting Up the Infrastructure

I have created a Terraform code to set up the entire infrastructure, including the installation of required applications, tools, and storage automatically created.

* â‡’ Virtual machines will be created named as `"devopsdemovm"`
    
* â‡’ Docker Install
    
* â‡’ Azure Cli Install
    
* â‡’ Storage Setup
    
* â‡’ ACR Setup
    

### Virtual Machine creation

First, we'll create the necessary virtual machines using `terraform` code.

Below is a terraform Code:

Once you [clone repo](https://github.com/mrbalraj007/Azure_DevOps_Projects/tree/main/Azure_DevOps_All_Projects/10_Real-Time-DevOps-Project_CI-CD_Terraform_ACR_Storage_WebApp) and run the terraform command.

```bash
$ ls -l
Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
dar--l          26/12/24   7:16 PM                pipeline
dar--l          23/12/24   3:38 PM                scripts
-a---l          25/12/24   2:31 PM            600 .gitignore
-a---l          26/12/24   9:29 PM           6571 EC2.tf
-a---l          26/12/24   9:29 PM            892 main.tf
-a---l          26/12/24   9:29 PM            567 output.tf
-a---l          26/12/24   9:29 PM            269 provider.tf
-a---l          26/12/24   9:30 PM            223 terraform.tfvars
-a---l          26/12/24   9:30 PM            615 variable.tf
```

You need to run the following terraform command.

Now, run the following command.

```bash
terraform init
terraform fmt
terraform validate
terraform plan
terraform apply 
# Optional <terraform apply --auto-approve>
```

After running the Terraform command, we will check the following things to ensure everything is set up correctly with Terraform.

### Inspect the `Cloud-Init` logs:

Once connected to VM then you can check the status of the `user_data` script by inspecting the log files

```bash
# Primary log file for cloud-init
sudo tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
                    or 
sudo cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log | more
```

* *If the user\_data script runs successfully, you will see output logs and any errors encountered during execution.*
    
* *If thereâ€™s an error, this log will provide clues about what failed.*
    

### Verify the Installation

* \[x\] Docker version
    

```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-95-197:~$ docker --version
Docker version 24.0.7, build 24.0.7-0ubuntu4.1


docker ps -a
ubuntu@ip-172-31-94-25:~$ docker ps
```

* \[x\] kubectl version
    

```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-89-97:~$ kubectl version
Client Version: v1.31.1
Kustomize Version: v5.4.2
```

* \[x\] Azure CLI version
    

```bash
azureuser@devopsdemovm:~$ az version
{
  "azure-cli": "2.67.0",
  "azure-cli-core": "2.67.0",
  "azure-cli-telemetry": "1.1.0",
  "extensions": {}
}
```
