This blog offers a practical, step-by-step guide to integrating Checkov into your Terraform workflow on Ubuntu 24 LTS. It helps you understand its importance and how it can benefit your infrastructure.

In the world of cloud-native applications and DevOps, security is crucial but often overlooked. As infrastructure as code (IaC) becomes standard, the need for a strong security framework that fits smoothly into the development process is more important than ever. This is where Checkov comes in. In this blog, we will explore what Checkov is, why it is essential, its key benefits, and a real-world example that shows its effectiveness. This guide is designed for users working with Ubuntu 24 LTS.

## What is Checkov?

Checkov is an open-source static code analysis tool designed specifically for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It scans your Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, and other IaC templates to identify potential security misconfigurations, policy violations, and compliance issues before they manifest in your infrastructure. By integrating Checkov into your CI/CD pipeline, you can ensure that your IaC adheres to best practices and security guidelines.

## Why Use Checkov?

As organizations increasingly adopt IaC to automate their infrastructure management, the need to secure these configurations becomes paramount. Misconfigurations in IaC templates can lead to significant vulnerabilities, exposing your infrastructure to potential threats. Checkov addresses this challenge by providing a proactive approach to IaC security.

## Key Reasons to Use Checkov:

**Early Detection of Issues:** Checkov allows you to catch security issues early in the development process, reducing the risk of deploying vulnerable configurations to your production environment.

* *Virtual Environment* (Optional but Recommended): It is a best practice to use a virtual environment to manage Python packages and dependencies.
    
* **Checkov CLI**
    
* **IaC language interpreter** (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc)
    
* **jq**
    

## Use Case: Integrating Checkov with a Terraform Project on Ubuntu 24 LTS

Let’s walk through a practical example where we integrate Checkov with a Terraform project. We’ll use Ubuntu 24 LTS as our operating system.

### Task 01. Install Checkov

**Step 1**: Install Python3 and Pip

Checkov is a Python-based tool, so the first step is to ensure Python3 and Pip are installed on your system.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip jq -y
```

**Step 2**: Install Checkov

With Python3 and Pip installed, you can now install Checkov using the following command:

```bash
pip3 install checkov -y
# Ref link: https://pypi.org/project/checkov/#files
```

I am getting this error message while installing it.

```bash
$ sudo pip3 install checkov
error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.

    If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
    create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
    Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
    sure you have python3-full installed.

    If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
    it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.

    See /usr/share/doc/python3.12/README.venv for more information.

note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.
```

### Solution for error:

#### Using a Virtual Environment

**Install Python Virtual Environment Packages**

First, make sure you have the *python3-venv* package installed, which allows you to create virtual environments:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-venv
```

**Create a Virtual Environment**

Create a virtual environment in a directory of your choice:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/checkov-venv
```

This will create a directory named checkov-venv in your home directory.

**Activate the virtual environment:**

```bash
source ~/checkov-venv/bin/activate
```

## Install Checkov

With the virtual environment activated, you can now install Checkov:

```bash
pip install checkov
```

Verify Checkov version

You can run Checkov from within this virtual environment. For example:

```bash
checkov
```

I am using version `3.2.223`

Create a basic Terraform configuration file ([main.tf](http://main.tf)):

```bash
touch main.tf
vi main.tf
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"
}
```

```bash
terraform init
```

### Task 06. Scan the Terraform Configuration with Checkov:

With your Terraform configuration in place, you can now run Checkov to scan the file for security issues.

```bash
cd ..
checkov -d terraform-checkov
