## Setting Up the Infrastructure

I have created Terraform code to set up the entire infrastructure, including the automatic installation of necessary software, and tools, and the creation of the web app.

Below is a terraform Code:

Once you [clone repo](https://github.com/mrbalraj007/Azure_DevOps_Projects/tree/main/Azure_DevOps_All_Projects/03.1_Real-Time-DevOps-Project_CI-CD_VMSS_Storage_webapp-YouTube_Clone) and run the terraform command.

```bash
$ ls -l
Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
dar--l          26/12/24   7:16 PM                pipeline
dar--l          23/12/24   3:38 PM                scripts
-a---l          25/12/24   2:31 PM            600 .gitignore
-a---l          26/12/24   9:29 PM           6571 VM_ACR.tf
-a---l          26/12/24   9:29 PM            892 main.tf
-a---l          26/12/24   9:29 PM            567 output.tf
-a---l          26/12/24   9:29 PM            269 provider.tf
-a---l          26/12/24   9:30 PM            223 terraform.tfvars
-a---l          26/12/24   9:30 PM            615 variable.tf
```

You need to run the following terraform command.

Now, run the following command.

```bash
terraform init
